# Decision record

Decisions settled in conversation on 2026-08-24 and 2026-08-25, before any code was written.
This record exists because these decisions are not derivable from the research documents, and several of them override those documents.
Research artefacts live in `../research/`.

## Product

The product bulk-uploads and cross-lists digital teaching resources across education marketplaces for teacher-authors, schools and agencies.
Phase-1 marketplaces are Tes Resources and TeachersPayTeachers, in that order.
Later candidates are Classful, Teach Simple and Made By Teachers.
Both sentences above are superseded by the wedge decision of 2026-08-25 below, which makes Tes GB-to-US duplication the first chargeable product, Etsy connector two, and TeachersPayTeachers a gated optional premium connector; the later candidates remain unscheduled rather than dropped.
The founder is an existing Tes author and is customer zero.

## Architecture

Automation runs server-side on infrastructure we operate.
This was a founder decision taken against the round-one research recommendation, which favoured local-first execution in the seller's own session on account-safety and credential-custody grounds.
The decision was made with those risks stated and is recorded here as deliberate rather than uninformed.

The client is thin.
Its job around sync is detailed progress reporting: files in sync, completed, failed, per marketplace.
Web client first, Android second.
Mobile is a full client rather than a read-only one, because the client performs no automation.

Rust is non-negotiable for the engine, all I/O, batch processing, the automation layer, and anything computationally heavy.
TypeScript is acceptable for the user interface only.

Sync is deterministic and cron-scheduled, never agent-driven.
Large language models are confined to listing-copy generation and to rediscovering a selector after a marketplace changes its markup.
No model decides what to sync, whether a sync succeeded, or how to recover.

## Credentials

Sellers supply their marketplace credentials, which we store encrypted with per-tenant data-encryption keys.
The founder recorded this as interim: "until we find a better way to have their creds."
Credential acquisition therefore sits behind a seam from the first commit, with one implementation today and room for two better ones later: an interactive remote browser the seller logs into themselves, and an official partner integration if either marketplace grants one.
The seam is cheap now and expensive to retrofit, which is the reason it exists.

## Hosting

The founder's own NixOS machine on a home connection initially, moving later to a dedicated NixOS box with production-grade server specifications.
This is load-bearing rather than a cost preference.
A probe on 2026-08-25 found TeachersPayTeachers returns HTTP 200 to a plain `curl` from the founder's consumer-ISP host, while earlier research measured HTTP 403 from Anthropic datacentre infrastructure.
TPT's `robots.txt` names `GPTBot`, `meta-externalagent`, `CCBot`, `ImagesiftBot` and `Applebot-Extended` in explicit stanzas, so the 403 was an AI-vendor block rather than a generic datacentre block.
If the eventual production box sits in a commercial datacentre, TPT reachability must be re-probed before it is relied on.
Egress must be fixed and declared in either case.

## Marketplace permission

No permission enquiries are being sent yet.
The Tes path is proved first.
This defers the question of whether the product has one marketplace or two, at no cost, because milestones M0 through M3 are Tes-only regardless.

## Engineering discipline

Guided by TigerBeetle's TIGER_STYLE and Holzmann's Power of Ten, filtered for what transfers to an async allocating Rust web service.
The filtering is the point: an adversarial review of the first charter draft found its flagship artefact did not compile and violated its own lint table twelve times, so the revised charter is gated on compilation.

## Scope explicitly deferred

The node-graph mapping canvas, in favour of a virtualised product-by-marketplace table.
The public versioned developer API, until a real third-party consumer exists.
Desktop clients, which the server-side architecture removes the need for.

## Open

Operating entity and jurisdiction are undecided, which forks the privacy regime, the consumer-law regime, the insurance market and the customer terms.

## Wedge, settled 2026-08-25

The first chargeable product is Tes GB-to-US inventory duplication, not cross-marketplace listing.
Tes runs disjoint GB and US inventories, so an author wanting both markets must upload twice under two resource ids at two prices against two taxonomies.
That is a bulk-tool job entirely inside one marketplace: no cross-marketplace mapping, no TeachersPayTeachers exposure, no bot-management vendor, and no dependence on the small TPT-and-Tes intersection.
It is bounded by Tes's whole author base — 23,266 American-oriented resources in a 1,039,401-resource catalogue — rather than by an estimated 4,000-seller overlap.
Every component it requires (catalogue, file pipeline, taxonomy projection, listing-copy rewriting, job ledger) is reused verbatim when a second marketplace arrives.

The Etsy Personal App and Commercial Access request is filed in week one and never placed on the critical path, because approval is a manual review with no published service-level agreement.
Etsy's API Terms grant the licence TPT and Tes both withhold.

TeachersPayTeachers is demoted to a gated, optional, premium connector.
Every screen must be complete and worth paying for without it.

## Demand evidence, recorded 2026-08-25

Ten measured TPT-and-Tes dual-listers hold 173 Tes listings against 7,644 TPT listings, 2.3% of their combined catalogue.
That figure is ambiguous rather than adverse: it measures behaviour under manual friction and cannot predict behaviour once the friction is removed.
The founder's own catalogue is the counter-evidence and the reason the premise is being pursued — most of it is on Tes only, because cross-listing by hand is not worth the time.
The founder is therefore customer zero for the exact problem, and M0's payoff is directly measurable against their own catalogue.
